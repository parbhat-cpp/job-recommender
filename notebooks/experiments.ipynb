         "About EliseAI\n\nEliseAI develops cutting-edge conversational AI technology for industries fundamental to our lives: housing and healthcare. Everything is built on the foundation of health and home. Broken systems or ineffective processes in these domains have a disproportionate impact on our quality of life and society’s overall wellbeing. Conversely, any solution or technology that solves problems in these areas will have an impact that ripples far beyond them.\n\nThat’s the only kind of impact we are interested in having at EliseAI. If you get excited by the thought of working really hard on these kinds of problems, then EliseAI is the right place for you.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nWe are looking for a AI Operations Specialist who will play a crucial role by working with the engineering and product team to ensure that our software products and applications meet the highest standards of quality before they are released to the public or implemented within an organization. Their primary responsibility is to identify defects, bugs, or any other issues that could compromise the functionality, usability, or security of the software.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\nEvaluate AI-generated text for factual accuracy, relevance, potential bias, safety, and other relevant criteria\n\nCollaborate with engineering and design team leaders to enhance tooling, identify and resolve bugs or performance bottlenecks, and conduct thorough testing of new functionalities aimed at improving the data annotation process\n\nPerforming various types of testing, such as functional testing, regression testing, integration testing, and performance testing, to assess the software's performance and functionality under different conditions\n\nThoroughly documenting and reporting any bugs, defects, or inconsistencies found during testing\n\nDeveloping test plans, test cases, and test scripts based on project requirements and specifications\n\nMaintaining comprehensive documentation of testing activities, including test plans, test cases, test results, and any relevant metrics or statistics\n\nAttract top-tier talent to join our driven team\n\nRequirements\n\nBachelor's degree or equivalent professional experience, with a demonstrated track record of creating and editing written communication as a core responsibility\n\nExcellent grammar and written communication skills in English\n\nTechnical familiarity with software and development - not necessary to be a developer\n\nVery strong attention to detail\n\nWillingness to work in person at our office 5 days a week\n\nWhy Join\n\nGrowth and impact. It’s not often that you can get in on the ground floor of a funded (unicorn!) startup that’s scaling. That means that instead of following a playbook, you’ll be writing it. Every single day you will be challenged to identify how we can scale and execute on it. You’ll learn what works when you succeed and what doesn’t when you fail. Either way, the rest of the team will be here to support you.\n\nBenefits\n\nIn addition to the growth and impact you’ll have at EliseAI, we offer competitive salaries along with the following benefits:\n\nEquity in the company in the form of stock options\n\nMedical, Dental and Vision premiums covered at 100%\n\nFully paid parental leave\n\nCommuter benefits\n\n401k benefits\n\nMonthly fitness stipend\n\nA collaborative in-office environment with an open floor plan, fully stocked kitchen, and company-paid lunch.\n\nFun company social events through our Elise and the City program\n\nUnlimited vacation and paid holidays\n\nWe'll cover relocation packages and make the move exciting, not painful!\n\nJob Compensation Range\n\nThe salary range for this role is $60,000 - $75,000. EliseAI offers a competitive total rewards package which includes base salary, equity, and a comprehensive benefits & perks package. Exact compensation is determined based on a number of factors including experience, skill level, location and qualifications which are assessed during the interview process.

We build free‑to‑play fantasy titles and real‑money Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) games across the NFL, NBA/WNBA, MLB, NHL, EU football, and more. Our Risk & Trading team safeguards game integrity and optimizes profitability through data‑driven pricing and exposure management.\n\nWhat You’ll Be Doing\n\nFeature engineering & model tuning – Own the pipelines that transform raw bet, player, and market data into features for our pricing and exposure models (BigQuery + SQLX, Python, Pandas).\n\nPredictive modeling – Train, validate, and deploy supervised and probabilistic models that forecast player performance, market volatility, and user value.\n\nGuardrail automation – Ship rule‑based limiters and anomaly‑detection jobs that run every few seconds, flagging and throttling outlier exposure before it becomes tail risk.\n\nDashboards & alerting – Build Grafana dashboards and SQLX reports that surface live liability, promo uptake, and top‑line KPIs to trading and exec stakeholders.\n\nLight on‑call rotation – During peak sports windows, respond to automated alerts and, if necessary, execute a manual override (price suspension / limit change). < 2 hrs/wk on average.\n\nCross‑functional collaboration – Pair with Backend & Data Engineers to productionize models, and with Product to iterate on game mechanics and promos.\n\nWho You Are\n\n3‑5 years in data science, machine learning, or quant research; comfortable owning end‑to‑end projects.\n\nFluent in Python, SQL, and modern ML tooling (scikit‑learn, XGBoost, Airflow or similar).\n\nFamiliar with sports data and the economics of fantasy / sportsbook markets; plus if you’ve built pricing or risk models.\n\nSystems thinker who anticipates failure modes and edge cases in real‑time environments.\n\nWilling to flex hours around major game slates; we’re a remote‑first team and optimize schedules for coverage & work‑life balance.\n\nNice‑to‑Haves\n\nExperience with BigQuery, Looker, dbt, or similar analytics stacks.\n\nExposure to real‑time streams (Kafka, Pub/Sub) and event‑driven architectures.\n\nPrior work building user‑level segmentation or LTV models.\n\nCompensation\n\nIn the United States, the reasonable base salary range for this role is $90 000 – $175 000 USD, plus equity and benefits (medical, dental, vision, PTO, 401k).

In past roles, we found it very hard to make a big impact when companies grow too large in size, which has a detrimental effect on the product and the impact any single individual can have. Our team includes designers, engineers, product experts, and finance & operation focused on one thing — connecting people over sports. We believe in fair and equitable pay. Certain locations in the United States require job postings to include a reasonable estimate of the base salary range and/or a general description of benefits and other compensation applicable to the role.\n\nCompetitive salary plus benefits including Medical, Dental, PTO, 401k.
